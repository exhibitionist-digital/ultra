# docs

Welp, if you've made it here, you probably have a basic **Ultra** project
running. If not try this...

```bash
deno run -A -r https://deno.land/x/ultra/create.ts
```

<small>FYI: You can pass custom options after this script to make this quicker in the future</small>

`react-query` `react-router` `tailwind` `emotion` `react-helmet`

Use it like...

```bash
deno run -A -r https://deno.land/x/ultra/create.ts tailwind react-query
```

### [Extending Ultra](#extending-ultra)

**Ultra** gives you the control to use (or not use) many of the most popular
React libraries out there. You will probably
need to update your `importMap.json`,  `server.tsx` and `client.tsx`

We've prepared the following examples for you:

#### [Routing](#routing)

- Wouter [(with-wouter)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-wouter)
- React Router [(with-react-router)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-react-router)

#### [Data Fetching](#data-fetching)

- React Query [(with-react-query)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-react-query)

#### [CSS](#css)

- Stitches [(with-stitches)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-stitches)
- Twind [(with-twind)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-twind)

<small>or just use plain old CSS, it's _way_ underrated.</small>

#### [Head](#head)

- React Helmet Async [(with-react-helmet-async)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-react-helmet-async)

#### [API Routes](#api-routes)

- Hono [(with-api-routes)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-api-routes)

#### [Middleware](#middleware)
Since **Ultra** uses Hono under-the-covers, it includes middleware support. Here is an example snippet added to `server.tsx` that will add a 'Server' header to every response:
```js
server.use('*', async (c, next) => {
  c.res.headers.set("Server", "Ultra Hono");
  await next();
});
```
If you look in the Dev Tools Network tab and click on localhost, you'll see this line in the Headers tab added to the Response Headers section:
```
server: Ultra Hono
```
See the [Hono middleware docs](https://honojs.dev/docs/api/middleware/) for more details.

#### [Zero-JS™](#zero-js)

**Ultra** has route-based server options which can be configured to disable hydration, as well as not ship _any_ JS to your users. Great for you young guns making your spammy marketing pages.

```js
server.get("/", async (context) => {
  const result = await server.render(<Home />, {
    generateStaticHTML: true,
    disableHydration: true,
  });
  return context.body(result, 200, {
    "content-type": "text/html",
  });
});
```

- Zero-JS™ [(bogus-marketing-or-blog)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/bogus-marketing-or-blog)

<small>As these options are route-based, you can make an app which mixes both types of routes/hydration. See what happens.</small>

<br/>

More examples can be found [here](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples)

<small>
  If there is an existing library that you want to use, there is a good chance
  you can create a custom integration. Use some of the examples above as a guide
  -- open a PR if you are keen.

### [Ultra Hooks](#ultra-hooks)

#### [useAsset](#useasset)

```js
import useAsset from "ultra/hooks/use-asset.js";

<link rel="preload" as="style" href={useAsset("/style.css")} />
```

`useAsset` allows **Ultra** to version your assets during build for deploying to production. In development it's a non-op.

#### [useServerInsertedHTML](#useflusheffects)

```js
import useServerInsertedHTML from "ultra/hooks/use-server-inserted-html.js";


const ServerApp = function () {
  /**
   * useServerInsertedHTML will inject the returned output into the rendered stream.
   */
  useServerInsertedHTML(() => {
    // ...
  });

  return (
    <App />
  );
};
```

Similar to the [hook](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/aef60dc581f564b64cfb7667cdca0bd3e3b6e366/packages/next/shared/lib/flush-effects.tsx) [available in Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/30997), for integrating 3rd party libraries with React 18 + Suspense.

#### [usePreload](#usepreload)

```js
import usePreload from "ultra/hooks/use-preload.js";

usePreload(${href})
```

This hook will insert a `<link rel="preload" />` tag into the head of the server render document. During client side transitions, this won't do anything.

### [Building for production](#building-for-production)

To run **Ultra** in production, we recommened using `ultra/build.ts`. It will do the following:

- Create a `.ultra` dir inside of your project
- Transpile your TypeScript and JSX to vanilla JS.
- Vendor all of your dependencies
- Version your source and public files
- Auto generate 2 (two) production import maps (One for client/hydration, and the other for server)

<small>There are many existing build files in our [example repos](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples).</small>

#### [Running production](#running-production)

You can `cd` into `.ultra` and run `deno task start` to see the production server running.

Production builds run with `--no-remote` 🔥

### [Deploying](#deploying)

> ⏳ Support for more edge providers coming soon!

#### [Deno Deploy](#deno-deploy)

Use this GitHub Action:

```yml
name: Deploy
on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write # Needed for auth with Deno Deploy
      contents: read # Needed to clone the repository

    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Deno
        uses: denoland/setup-deno@main
        with:
          deno-version: 1.25.1

      - name: Build site
        run: deno run -A ./build.ts # Your build script

      - name: Upload to Deno Deploy
        uses: denoland/deployctl@v1
        with:
          project: "PROJECT_NAME" # Your deploy project name
          entrypoint: "server.js"
          root: .ultra
          import-map: importMap.server.json
```

#### [Fly/Docker](#flydocker)

Use this `Dockerfile`. It is multi-stage, and will both build and run the production ready app.

```bash
FROM denoland/deno:1.25.0 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN deno task build

FROM denoland/deno:1.25.0
EXPOSE 8000
COPY --from=builder /app/.ultra /app
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["deno", "task", "start"]
```

You can modify this as needed, another possible Dockerfile assumes you commit your build artifacts, or deploy locally from built files.

```bash
FROM denoland/deno:1.25.0
EXPOSE 8000
WORKDIR /app
COPY .ultra /app
CMD ["deno", "task", "start"]
```
