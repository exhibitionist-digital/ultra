You awake... the year is <span title="Yes, this is a joke">\{new Date().getFullYear()\}</span>...<br/><br/>**[ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)** have been standardised and supported in all relevant browsers...<br/><br/>The potential for elegant code, powerful experiences, and browser-native superpowers knows no bounds...

Yet, roaming hordes of club-weilding orcs continue the ancient practice of <span>"bundling"</span>...<br/><br/>A practice that dates back to the prehistoric times of <span>Internet Explora</span>.<br/><br/>Surely, this is some kind of sick joke? Do they not know about things like **[import maps](https://wicg.github.io/import-maps/)** and **[dynamic imports](https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import)**?

<span>Our mission:</span><br/>Rely on web standards, utilise web APIs, write apps that work identically in the browser and on the runtime.<br/><br/>Do we bundle?<br/><span>No, we use import maps and ESM from top to bottom.</span><br/><br/>Do we ship js?<br/><span>Yes, we love it.</span> <span>Browser is life, and javascript is good.</span><br/><br/>Can I use JSX and TypeScript?<br/><span>If you want.</span>
