# philosophy

**Ultra** takes a non-prescriptive approach to web-app development. You can configure it to use most existing libraries that you are accustomed to â€” or you can write your own... 

We want **Ultra** to do a few things, and do them well.

- React Streaming SSR, with Suspense support
- Native import maps from top to bottom
- Import maps with vendored dependencies in production
- Shipping pure, unbundled ESM always
- Simplifying your tool chain, removing the 'black-box bundler' approach
- Write apps that work the same way in the browser that they do on the server
- Utilise service workers to cache your ESM source code

### [Breakdown of a basic **Ultra** project](#breakdown-of-a-basic-ultra-project)

To follow along at home, run this command to quickly scaffold out a basic **Ultra** project.

```sh
deno run -A -r https://deno.land/x/ultra/create.ts
```

#### [importMap.json](#importmapjson)

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0",
    "react/": "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0/",
    "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0",
    "react-dom/": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/",
    "ultra/": "https://deno.land/x/ultra@v2.0.0-alpha.6/"
  }
}
```

Atm, these are the only deps required to run an **Ultra** project. Simple, I like it.

#### [server.tsx](#servertsx)

```js
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.153.0/http/server.ts";
import { createServer } from "ultra/server.ts";
import App from "./src/app.tsx";

const server = await createServer({
  importMapPath: import.meta.resolve("./importMap.json"),
  browserEntrypoint: import.meta.resolve("./client.tsx"),
});

server.get("*", async (context) => {
  /**
   * Render the request
   */
  const result = await server.render(<App />);

  return context.body(result, 200, {
    "content-type": "text/html",
  });
});

serve(server.fetch);
```

This file controls how your app will render on the server. It's using Deno's std http server, you can probably use another one if you want.

`createServer` kickstarts the **Ultra** renderer and static asset pipeline, it only needs your import map and client entry point.

You can also look at creating API routes here by following [this example](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-api-routes).

#### [client.tsx](#clienttsx)

```js
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./src/app.tsx";

hydrateRoot(document, <App />);  
```

This should look familiar to most... This is your client entrypoint, and what is used for client rendering. It can be customised if needed.

#### [src/](#src)

Put your source code here.

#### [public/](#public)

Static files go here. When building for production, these files will be versioned.

#### [deno.json](#denojson)

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "dev": "deno run -A --no-check --watch ./server.tsx",
    "build": "deno run -A ./build.ts",
    "start": "ULTRA_MODE=production deno run -A --no-remote ./server.js"
  },
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsxdev",
    "jsxImportSource": "react"
  },
  "importMap": "./importMap.json"
}
```

We use Deno's native task runner/config file. 

Try running `deno task dev`: This will spin up a development server and watch for file changes.

We use the `react-jsx` and `react` compiler options so you don't need to `import React from 'react'` everywhere.
