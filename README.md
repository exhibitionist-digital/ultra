\* If you want to get very meta (not facebook), **Ultra** can be viewed as a
tiny bridge to utilise native browser features üåê whilst using popular front-end
libraries. üß∞

## üßô Start your journey

Here's a basic **Ultra** project to set you on your way.

```sh
deno run -A -r https://deno.land/x/ultra/create.ts
```

## ‚ú® What's new

**Ultra** allows you to write web-apps which massively simplify your tool chain.
You write ESM, we ship ESM. Where we are going, there is no "bundling" (it feels
so 2018 just saying that word).

- Less opinionated, BYO routing, styling, data fetching, and head libraries
- Support for much of the React ecosystem by custom server/client
  controls<sup>**</sup>
- Native import maps in browser ü§ñ
- Localised import maps for production üî•
- API routing
- Overhaul of internal source code
- Updated Deno Deploy support

\*\* _Examples include (but not limited to) `react-query` `twind` `stitches`
`react-router` `wouter` `mdx`_ **@__@**

**Does Ultra _'ship js'_?**

Yes, **Ultra** creates rich web applications which allow complex client-side
routing, allow components to persist through route changes (media players,
interactive elements, etc).

Our goal is to both write _AND_ ship source code that works the same way on
server/runtime and client. We view the browser as more than just a "target".
Browser is life, and javascript is good.

**Can I use TypeScript and/or JSX?**

If you want.

**What native browser features should we all be using more?**

Unbundled ESM, service workers, universal import maps, cascading style sheets.

**Ultra always has been (and always will be) powered by the following
hot-takes:**

- **ESM** is non-negotiable in {currentYear}
- **SSR** is non-negotiable in {currentYear}
- Bundling is an **anti-pattern** in {currentYear}
- **Data can be requested anywhere, and is accessible on the server, always**
- **Lazy routing with dynamic imports** trumps FS routing
- **Less magic** in tooling and frameworks is a good thing
- **Simplify** your workflow and tech stack at all costs - life is too short
- **Streams** are neat
